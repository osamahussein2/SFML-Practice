For now, it is much more important to talk about the why of references. There are two reasons to use references, and we have
already mentioned them. Here they are, summarized again:

1. Changing/reading the value of a variable/object in another function, which is otherwise out of scope.

2. Passing/returning to/from a function without making a copy (and, therefore, more efficiently).
